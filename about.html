            <h1>My Story</h1><p></p>

            My name is Michael Emmons and I grew up and lived in upstate New York for 24 years. Shortly after obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Communications from SUNY Cortland, I moved from my northern roots and headed south to Charlotte, North Carolina. The move was motivated by a lackluster job market followed by a devastating recession.<p></p>

After a few months moving down to Charlotte,  I was able to obtain a job in the finance industry through Wells Fargo. From there I have built relationships with my clients and developed professional strengths. Being in the finance industry as a banker and a Home Equity lending specialist for 5 years has allowed me to gain valuable experience. I was able to work with an affluent clientele due to my background in financial consulting, leadership, management, sales, and customer service. Though I had a stellar reputation with my managers and peers, I still found myself lacking passion in my current profession. To fill this void, I began looking at different careers. I knew I wanted something that was challenging yet also creative. <p></p>

That new passion is web development.  I recently completed web development program through UNCC with the purpose of becoming a full stack developer. This new purpose and passion has allowed me to receive the challenge of non-stop learning and use of my creative side.
<p></p>
